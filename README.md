hledger-mode
============

A mode for writing hledger journals with a set of useful reports.
This mode requires `utils.el` which is a part of my `.emacs.d/` in
my dotfiles repository. I am trying to separate this out so that
it is useful for others. Any help would be appreciated! :)

A more experimental and updated version would be available here:
